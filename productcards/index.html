                        <p class="fix">Refreshing, just like a slice of fruit on a warm summer day. Wait, these fruit slices aren’t exactly like slices of fruit. There are a few differences including the fact that they are sticks, seedless, and candy. Nevertheless, they’re still incredibly refreshing. Perfect for events, add this box of individually wrapped pink and green hard candies to the candy buffet table or party favor bags--just maybe not the fruit bar.</p>

                        <p class="fix-3">We love mornings. Maybe it’s because we look forward to heading out bright and early to pluck some juicy red strawberry Lollipops from the fields and pack them into our sweet boxes. We find them still glistening in the morning dew, each pop growing with its own wrapper to seal in the fresh fruit flavor right from the start, and the suckers themselves always emerge striped with the most lovely pink spiral designs. Add a few of your own to your shopping cart today, and let the harvest begin!

                        <p>After submerging your taste buds with cherry flavor from this cherry sour pop, you’d think you tasted a piece of fruit straight from the tree. Now, if you want to say the sweet box came from a tree you totally can, but we both know that it didn't. But perhaps it will help make the uncanny fruit flavor from this double sided lollipop make more sense. That way you can simply enjoy the flavor without wondering, "How did they do this? How did they make it taste exactly like a cherry?" If it’s still on your brain, try bringing them with you to work. We’re pretty sure you’ll get lots of visitors and possibly a think tank going to tackle the mystery.</p>

                        <p>French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence... and these purple-striped Sticklettes are inspired by that same quality! Fresh from the vines of the candy-selling region of the California coast (Long Beach, to be precise) comes a sweet candy variety of subtle excellence. A spiral of heliotrope tastefully frames Twists Purple and Orange Candy Sticks. On the palate, these Twists have that perfect balance between sugary hard candy snap and sun-ripened grape-flavored savor. Paired well with poultry, game, or a box of Razzles, Sticklettes are the perfect addition to any dinner party. Just don’t try to make grappa out of the wrappers.</p>
